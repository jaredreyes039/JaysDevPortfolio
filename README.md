# Welcome to My Portfolio
---

## Description
- Welcome to the code base for my new and improved developer portfolio. Rich in **animation** and **nerdy features** dedicated to my love of the *unix* systems and *bash* syntax, this portfolio is my proudest update yet, and I hope you enjoy your visit! Including my new experiences in *cybersecurity*, as well as rephrasing and reincorporating my past experiences, I hope that my portfolio shows my **dedication to development** (and tech in general) as well as my **determiniation to keep growing** everyday!

## Stack Information
- Built entirely in **MERN**
    - **SASS** implemented for more efficient styling
    - EmailJS considered, but highly unlikely due to cost barriers
- Tested w/ **Jest** for React

## Extra Information
- Design work entirely done in **Figma**
    - All designs, SVG's, logos, etc. are mine entirely
- IP & Subnet information is NOT based on client, I would never risk your security like that!

## Reach Out
- Find a **bug** or **vulnerability** in my code? Please reach out to me, I would love to learn your methodology and begin problem-solving as soon as possible!
